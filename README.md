# Python Projects

This repository contains **Python projects focused on Cybersecurity, SOC operations, and Blue Team practices**.

The goal of these projects is to demonstrate **hands-on skills**. Each project was built to simulate real-world scenarios such as:

- Network reconnaissance and port scanning
- Email forensics and phishing analysis
- IOC extraction and enrichment
- Security automation fundamentals

All projects are designed for:

- Learning and skill development
- SOC / Blue Team portfolios
- Interview preparation
- Lab and defensive security environments

> ⚠️ These tools are intended for **educational and defensive purposes only**.  
> Use them only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
