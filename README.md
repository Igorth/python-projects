## Introduction

This repository contains a variety of Python projects that I completed while learning the language. These projects helped me understand and apply key Python concepts, and they were developed following courses on Udemy and YouTube.

## Projects

### Blackjack

A simple text-based Blackjack game where you can play against the computer. This project helped me understand loops, conditionals, and basic game logic.

### Caesar Cipher

An implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption technique. This project was a great way to learn about string manipulation and encryption basics.

### Coffee Machine

A simulation of a coffee machine that can serve different types of coffee. This project involved working with dictionaries and functions.

### Guess Game

A number guessing game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number. This project was useful for practicing loops and conditional statements.

### Hangman

The classic Hangman game where the player guesses letters to form a word. This project helped me work with lists and control flow.

### Higher Lower Game

A game where players guess which of two options has a higher value. This project focused on comparison operations and loops.

### Password Generator

A tool to generate random passwords with specific criteria. This project involved working with randomization and string operations.

### Prime Number

A program to check if a number is prime and to generate prime numbers. This project was useful for learning about loops and conditional logic.

### Quiz Game

A simple quiz game that asks multiple-choice questions. This project involved working with data structures like lists and dictionaries.

## Concepts Used

- Lists
- Tuples
- Dictionaries
- Sets
- Loops (for and while)
- Logical Comparators
- Conditional Statements (if and else)

## Learning Resources

These projects were created as part of my learning journey using various courses and tutorials on Udemy and YouTube.
